Although San Francisco’s overall crime rate has dropped to historic lows, vehicle theft has had a turbulent journey. From sharp declines fueled by tech, to spikes after a major prison policy shift, to a quiet takedown of international car theft rings — this story reveals how car theft in SF mirrors larger criminal justice trends.

- **2006 – Technology Helps Reduce Car Theft**  
  Before 2006, car theft was one of the most common crimes in San Francisco. But that all started to change as new technologies and smarter law enforcement tactics took hold. By 2006, the number of car thefts had dropped significantly. Some of the key innovations that made this possible included:  
  - The use of “bait cars” with hidden cameras and GPS trackers to catch thieves in the act  
  - Automated license plate readers (ALPR) that helped police track stolen vehicles in real-time  
  - Cars with upgraded factory security systems, making it harder for thieves to break in or drive away

- **2011 – The Rise**  
  In 2011, California implemented AB 109: Public Safety Realignment, a major reform that diverted lower-level offenders from state prisons to county jails — or, in many cases, no incarceration at all. This new legislation caused significant issues, including:  
  - Thousands of offenders being released or left unsupervised  
  - Counties struggling with overcrowded jails  
  - A dramatic increase in motor vehicle theft  
  The **Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC)** ([PPIC, 2013](https://www.ppic.org/publication/public-safety-realignment-and-crime-rates-in-california/)) reported that the rise in thefts was directly tied to the realignment policies. This period marked the reversal of a long-term decline in car thefts, especially in urban centers like San Francisco.
