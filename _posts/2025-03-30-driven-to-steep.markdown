Although San Francisco’s overall crime rate has dropped to historic lows, vehicle theft has had a turbulent journey. From sharp declines fueled by tech, to spikes after a major prison policy shift, to a quiet takedown of international car theft rings — this story reveals how car theft in SF mirrors larger criminal justice trends.

<span style="font-size: 20px">Timeline:</span>

-   **2006 – Technology Helps Reduce Car Theft**  
    Before 2006, car theft was one of the most common crimes in San Francisco. But that all started to change as new technologies and smarter law enforcement tactics took hold. By 2006, the number of car thefts had dropped significantly. Some of the key innovations that made this possible included:

    -   The use of “bait cars” with hidden cameras and GPS trackers to catch thieves in the act
    -   Automated license plate readers (ALPR) that helped police track stolen vehicles in real-time
    -   Cars with upgraded factory security systems, making it harder for thieves to break in or drive away

    ([East Bay Times, 2007](https://www-eastbaytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.eastbaytimes.com/2007/02/16/car-thefts-decrease-statewide/amp/?amp_gsa=1&amp_js_v=a9&usqp=mq331AQIUAKwASCAAgM%3D#amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&aoh=17430097887173&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eastbaytimes.com%2F2007%2F02%2F16%2Fcar-thefts-decrease-statewide%2F))

-   **2011 – The Rise**  
    In 2011, California implemented AB 109: Public Safety Realignment, a major reform that diverted lower-level offenders from state prisons to county jails — or, in many cases, no incarceration at all. This new legislation caused significant issues, including:

    -   Thousands of offenders being released or left unsupervised
    -   Counties struggling with overcrowded jails
    -   A dramatic increase in motor vehicle theft

    The **Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC)** ([PPIC, 2013](https://www.ppic.org/publication/public-safety-realignment-and-crime-rates-in-california/)) reported that the rise in thefts was directly tied to the realignment policies. This period marked the reversal of a long-term decline in car thefts, especially in urban centers like San Francisco.

-   **2016-2018 – Tackling the Surge in Car Theft**  
    Between 2016 and 2018, California took significant steps to curb the rising rates of car theft under Senate Bill 1743, also known as the Motor Vehicle Theft Prevention Act ([SB 1743, 2017/2018](https://staging.chp.ca.gov/siteassets/files/2017-motor-vehicle-theft-prevention-act-report.pdf)). The state's Foreign Export and Recovery (FEAR) teams ramped up their efforts, focusing on high-risk areas like the Bay Area.  
    The Northern FEAR Team, responsible for San Francisco and surrounding counties, deployed several key strategies to tackle the issue:

    -   Conducting export inspections at the Port of Oakland to intercept stolen vehicles bound for international markets
    -   Collaborating with other law enforcement agencies to carry out multi-agency sweeps targeting repeat offenders

    One of the most notable operations during this time was **Operation Cold Day**, a major crackdown on organized theft rings. In collaboration with the San Francisco Police Department and other agencies, the operation led to the recovery of stolen vehicles—including high-end models like a Lexus and a Mercedes—destined for overseas sale.

-   **2020–2022 – The Pandemic Crime Shift & the TikTok Effect**  
    While overall crime in San Francisco declined during the pandemic, car thefts surged, jumping approximately 42% from 2019 to 2022 ([Axios, 2023](https://www.axios.com/local/san-francisco/2023/03/21/san-francisco-car-thefts-overall-crime-trends)). Several key factors contributed to this increase:

    -   Reduced police presence – Pandemic-related constraints led to fewer traffic stops and patrols, creating more opportunities for car thieves ([SF Chronicle, 2021](https://www.sfchronicle.com/crime/article/This-is-how-the-pandemic-changed-crime-in-every-16107691.php)).
    -   Economic strain – Widespread financial hardship correlated with a rise in property crimes, including auto theft.
    -   The “Kia Boyz” trend – A viral TikTok challenge showed how to hotwire certain Kia and Hyundai models using a USB cable. This led to a wave of thefts nationwide, with San Francisco among the hardest-hit cities ([SFGate, 2023](https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/here-s-kia-s-stolen-across-country-17865710.php)).

    By the end of 2022, vehicle thefts in San Francisco had reached their highest levels in nearly a decade, following a broader national trend ([NICB, 2022](https://www.nicb.org/news/news-releases/nicb-report-finds-vehicle-thefts-continue-skyrocket-many-areas-us#:~:text=DES%20PLAINES%2C%20Ill.%2C%20September,a%2017%25%20increase%20since%202019.)).

-   **2024 – Record Low Crime & Reform Efforts**  
    After years of fluctuations, San Francisco’s overall crime rate dropped to its lowest level in 23 years. Both violent and property crimes saw double-digit declines compared to 2023, with car burglaries and auto thefts among the most significant decreases ([NBC Bay Area, 2025](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco-crime-rate-drop-lowest-level-stats/3754109/)). Several factors affected this shift:

    -   Major drop in car burglaries – Car break-ins fell by more than half, marking one of the sharpest declines in recent history.
    -   Police reform efforts – The SFPD implemented nearly all of the 272 reforms introduced in 2017, which officials say helped improve public trust and efficiency.
    -   Tech-assisted enforcement – Officers expanded their use of automated license plate readers and drones to deter and track auto theft.
    -   Stronger coordination – A better working relationship between SFPD and the district attorney’s office played a role in more effective policing strategies.

    By the end of 2024, San Francisco recorded its lowest homicide rate since the early 1960s, and overall crime rates returned to levels not seen since 2001. While challenges remain, officials credited a mix of proactive enforcement, technology, and long-term reform efforts for the decline.
